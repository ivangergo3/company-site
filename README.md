# own-html-site

This is a plain HTML + CSS site, does not use any javascript on the site itself.
It has a minimal [backend](https://github.com/ivangergo3/company-site-backend), that is written in Typescript, just to be able to send the emails for the contact us form.

It has a dark/light theme selector, unfortunatelly without javascript if you refresh the page the state will set back to default. The site has a menu that navigates in the same page to the given parts, the site is fully reponsive.
